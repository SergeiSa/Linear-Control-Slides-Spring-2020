# Lecture 7- CTC, linear control for nonlinear systems

**Objectives**:

- Error dynamics
- CTC
- CTC stability
- Linearization of non-linear dynamics

#### Error dynamics

Before the Error dynamics, it's important to understand **Control error**. The Control error ***e*** is the difference between the desired/reference ***q**** and the output ***q***. Mathematically,
$$
e = q^* - q
$$

Now we can define the Error dynamics with controller gains $K_d$ and $K_p$ to be

$$
\ddot{e} + K_d\dot{e} + K_pe = 0
$$
**Briefly on Robot dynamics**

If we were to analyze a robots movement, its dynamics would be expressed as
$$
H(q)\ddot{q} + c(q,\dot{q}) = \tau	\\
\tau = Bu
$$
In this equation, $q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q}$ and $\tau$ are vectors of joint position, velocity, acceleration and force variables, respectively, and they are called the joint-space position, velocity, acceleration and force vectors. Each is an n-dimensional coordinate vector, where n is the number of (independent) joint variables in the mechanism. 

**H** is called the **joint-space inertia matrix**, and it is an *n*×*n* symmetric, positive-definite matrix. **c** is called the **joint-space bias force**, which is the value of the joint-space force that must be applied to the system in order to produce zero acceleration.

You can read more on this on your own.

Assuming we want to control a robot arm. We know the Error and Robot dynamics, hence

- First recall the Error dynamic

  $\ddot{q^*} - \ddot{q} + K_d\dot{e} + K_pe = 0$

- Then add H
> Note that **H** is *invertible* [^invertible]
>
> [^invertible]: is a square **matrix** that the product of the **matrix** and its inverse is the identity **matrix**

  $H\ddot{q^*} - H\ddot{q} + H(K_d\dot{e} + K_pe) = 0$

- $H\ddot{q} + c = H\ddot{q^*} + H(K_d\dot{e} + K_pe) + c$

- Since we know that $H\ddot{q} + c = Bu$, we get

  $Bu = \tau = H\ddot{q^*} + H(K_d\dot{e} + K_pe) + c$

And this is the **Computed Torque Controller** which we will look at just below.

#### CTC

Computed Torque Controller (CTC)  is a powerful nonlinear controller which it widely used in control robot manipulator. It is based on Feed-back linearization and computes the required arm torques using the nonlinear feedback control law. The equation for the Computed Torque Controller from the calculation above is

$$
\tau = (H\ddot{q^*} + c) + H(K_d\dot{e} + K_pe)
$$

And this equation above can be divided into two: Feedback and Feedforward parts.

The Feedback part (for tracking a reference input) is
$$
\tau_{FB} = H(K_d\dot{e} + K_pe)
$$
While the Feedforward part (for eliminating nonlinear terms of the system ) is

$$
\tau_{FF} = H\ddot{q^*} + c
$$
**CTC Stability**

In order to find the stability of a CTC, first let's the Error dynamics $\ddot{e} + K_d\dot{e} + K_pe = 0$. After recalling that, the stability criteria is pretty straightforward.

If $K_d$ and $K_p$ are negative definite [^negative definite] then it is stable.

[^negative definite]: A *negative definite matrix* is a Hermitian *matrix* all of whose eigenvalues are *negative*.

#### Linearization
Most systems we model are nonlinear but it's easier to identify the properties and relationship between variables if the system is linear, hence the need to linearize.

**Simple Linearization** 

For a given nonlinear system

$$
\dot{x} = f(x,u)
$$
We simply compute
$$
A := \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=x(0) \\ u=u(0)}},	\hspace{15mm} 
B :=  \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=x(0) \\ u=u(0)}}
$$

**Affine system**

If the system is affine [^affine], the resulting linear system c will be

[^affine]: **Affine systems** are nonlinear **systems** that are linear in the input


$$
c = f(x(0), u(0)) - \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=x(0) \\ u=u(0)}} -  \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=x(0) \\ u=u(0)}}
$$

**Jacobian Linearization of non-linear dynamics**

For a given nonlinear system

$$
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t))
$$
where f is a function mapping $ℝ^n × ℝ^m → ℝ^n$ . We describe the  Jacobian Linearization of the original nonlinear system, about the equilibrium point ($\bar{x}, \bar{u}$) as follows.

First what is the equilibrium point? A point $\bar{x} ∈ ℝ^n$ is called an **equilibrium point** if there is a specific $\bar{u} ∈ ℝ^m$ (called the equilibrium input) such that
$$
f(\bar{x}, \bar{u}) = 0_n
$$
Also, we include a notion called deviation variables to measure the difference  if we start a little bit away from $\bar{x}$, and we apply a slightly different input from $\bar{u}$.

$$
\delta_x(t) := x(t) - \bar{x}	\\
\delta_u(t) := u(t) - \bar{u}
$$
Now we can substitute using the equilibrium points and deviation variables, we get
$$
\dot{\delta_x}(t) = f(\bar{x} + \delta_x(t), \bar{u} + \delta_u(t))
$$
Then we do a Taylor expansion and get
$$
\dot{\delta_x}(t) \approx f(\bar{x}, \bar{u}) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=\bar{x} \\ u=\bar{u}}} \delta_x(t) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=\bar{x} \\ u=\bar{u}}} \delta_u(t)
$$
However, recalling from our explanation of equilibrium point $f(\bar{x}, \bar{u}) = 0$, we get
$$
\dot{\delta_x}(t) \approx  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=\bar{x} \\ u=\bar{u}}} \delta_x(t) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=\bar{x} \\ u=\bar{u}}} \delta_u(t)
$$
So we define constant matrices A and B such that

$$
A := \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=\bar{x} \\ u=\bar{u}}} \in ℝ^{nxn},	\hspace{15mm} 
B :=  \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\Bigg|_{\substack{x=\bar{x} \\ u=\bar{u}}} \in ℝ^{nxm}
$$
Finally, we get a linear system

$$
\dot{\delta_x}(t) =  A\delta_x(t) + B\delta_u(t)
$$
